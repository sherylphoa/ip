I utilized Gemini (Flash 3) to assist in the development of Sasa. 

A-Assertions
Suggested locations for state checks in Parser and TaskList.

A-CodeQuality
Assisted in applying SLAP by extracting message generation logic in TaskList.
Assisted in shortening long methods

Generating Javadoc comments 

What worked well
- The AI was good at spotting long methods and suggesting ways to improve code quality by shortening the methods
- It saved me time generating Javadoc comments

Challenges encountered
- Occasionally, the AI would suggest code that used different method signatures than what I had already implemented, 
requiring manual alignment.
- One suggestion included a syntax error which required manual correction.
